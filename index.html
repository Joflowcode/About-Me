    </header>

    <p id = Short Biograph>
      I may be a speck in the grand scheme of things in this beautiful and massive cosmos larger than my mind could even visualize, but I plan to enjoy and make the most of it.


    </p>

    <p id = Education History>
      I do significant amounts of independent study, but I am nearly done with my Healthcare Management degree. Two years ago I realized I didn't want this path and wanted Health Informatics as a natural switch, but then Covid happened, and the rest is well, history and the present.

      The technical side started interesting me more and I did some practicing here and there but nothing as intense and structured as this. Too much thoery reading, which is important in computer science, but far too little actual practice and lab type work.

      I have taken classes and have completed projects in

      <ul>
        <li>Technology Applications in Healthcare</li>
        <li>Healthcare Delivery Systems, Regulation, and Compliance</li>
        <li>Healthcare Operations Management</li>
        <li>Marketing</li>
        <li>Business Law</li>        
        <li>and others</li>

      

      Additionally I have an interest and study of healthcare policies and laws, and privacy laws.


      </ul>
    </p>

    <p id = Job History>
      
      My background is mostly healthcare adminstration and health insurance. I started as a customer service rep for Medicaid, and eventually a team lead in health insurance. Also was a coordinator for Emergency/Inpatient/Outpatient Admits, and Cath Lab at a hospital. 

      In most of my jobs I either took the iniative or was assignmed documentation creation or organization which I enjoyed.

      I've also done TaskRabbit and dog walking.
