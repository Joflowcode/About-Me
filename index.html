      <h1>About Me</h1>
    </header>

    <p id = Short Biography>
      I may be a speck in the grand scheme of things in this beautiful and massive cosmos larger than my mind could even visualize, but I plan to enjoy and make the most of it.


    </p>
    <h3>Education History</h3>
    <p id = Education History>
      I do significant amounts of independent study, but I am nearly done with my Healthcare Management degree. Two years ago I realized I didn't want this path and wanted Health Informatics as a natural switch, but then Covid happened, and the rest is well, history and the present.

      The technical side started interesting me more and I did some practicing here and there but nothing as intense and structured as this. Too much thoery reading, which is important in computer science, but far too little actual practice and lab type work.

      I have taken classes and have completed projects in

      <ul>
        <li>Technology Applications in Healthcare</li>
        <li>Healthcare Delivery Systems, Regulation, and Compliance</li>
        <li>Healthcare Operations Management</li>
        <li>Marketing</li>
        <li>Business Law</li>        
        <li>and others</li>
      </ul>

      <p>Additionally I have an interest and study of healthcare policies and laws, and privacy laws.</p>

    </p>

    <h3>Job History</h3>
      <p id = Job History>
      My background is mostly healthcare adminstration and health insurance. I started as a customer service rep for Medicaid, and eventually a team lead in health insurance. Also was a coordinator for Emergency/Inpatient/Outpatient Admits, and Cath Lab at a hospital. 

      In most of my jobs I either took the iniative or was assignmed documentation creation or organization which I enjoyed.

      Some fun random jobs I've had was doing TaskRabbit and dog walking.

  <h3>Goals</h3>
    <p id = Goals>
     There are so many goals I have! I make weekly, monthly, quarterly, yearly, 50 year goals! Always working towards something or tweaking a current one.
     
    <p>Currently here are a few goals:
    </p>
     
      <ul>
        <li>Spend at least 30 mins to an hour a day reviewing CompTia A+ prep</li>
        <li>Enroll and pass CodeFellows Software Development through 301</li>
        <li>Apply after Code 201 for the CyberSecurity Program and demonstration my perserverence and work</li>
        <li>Write at least one letter a month to legislators, news editors for Citizen Climate Lobby and reach o</li>
        <li>Develop the ADHD planner that will finally be the magic one that does all my work. But in seriousness, working on a program that is simple in action, but complicated enough for engagement and to keep interest. Ah the ADHD conundrum. Not a psychology professional so still doing research and input</li>
        <li>Find a new mentor in my new field</li>
        <li>Become a mentor to someone</li>
        <li>Build a program that will find all mentions of me on Internet and a tracker of which companies I have given my data to track who is sharing, what they are sharing, why they are sharing, and if they have my permission to share. Data collection and analytics is critical in tech, but as an individual I want more control over my data or at least the information on where it is and what it is being used for.</li>
      </ul>

      <!--- This will likely be my permenant public About Me page so I am laying the foundation for various content that will change overtime. For labs and partner assignment, all the required work is going to be on index.html and review and additional work not needed on these for simplicity-->
