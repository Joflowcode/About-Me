   <!--  <p>Yes. Several years ago I used to play more video games. I was not really a multiplayer gamer, but I had moved to a different state and didn't know many people. My best friend though played the game, and her, her husband, and my older brother started playing it. None of us saw the way I took to the game.
      
    <p>I am a terrible gamer many times because I always love to pick the magic or distance characters. Yet my favorite way to attack is to bop enemies over the head with my long range weapon. It cracks me up and makes the game fun.</p>
  
  <p>The Old Republic was fun because it interested teamwork and healing. I LOVED healing. Then I maxed level and found something called Endgame content.</p>

And it was hard. And I found myself joining a "casual hardcore guild............."</p>
