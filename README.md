### Reflections and Comments

Something I wrote my first week of class and consider now for this entire journey as a reminder:

Having an interest in IT and computers you naturally pick up some things here and there. And like I heard in a Cybersecurity podcast from InfoSec, many casual tech learners are like swiss cheese. Lots of cheese, but lots of holes. And that can present some interesting hurdles during the learning process if not careful. My first week I was thrown off balance by how much I knew, but soon realized how much I still needed to learn. Even things I considered "easier" were still a process.

That can seem discouraging not readily getting something that is considered easier. But don't let that stop you, and keep practicing! This is the foundation, the part where our brains are plastisity is working to build new pathways to learn a new skill. It will not be instant. But what we learn from this intro class will serve us well our entire career.

Compare it to a celebrated and world renknowed musician. Maybe they find writing the musical notes for their songs too time consuming and tedious after some time. They may use digital music devices and programs to make composing their work quicker and more efficient. Perhaps they plug their keyboard to a computer and instead of having to write the musical notes down themselves, the computer can record and print it for them.

But they didn't start there. They got a music book and learned to read and write all the musical notes to get a strong knowledge of the very foundation of music. By learning to read music they were able to apply that skill to a multitude of instruments not just one. So if the program crashes. Or their software doesn't work or no longer available, they don't need to rely on a system that does all the work for them. Eventually, it will not be neccessary to write our code in markdown for this course. There are smart and intuitive programs that know many programming languages to streamline the work.

Yet with knowlege of the foundation blocks, it can prepare us to be skilled to learn more complex languages. And just as if the musician has backup, with basic markdown coding skills, if a program license expires, or an application has difficulty with HTML and other languages, we will always have markdown syntax in our back pocket.

Keeping in theme with the timely message of having a growth mindset from Class 01, I aim to not look at things as "easy" or "difficult". Everything is something that needs to be learned, and some things take additional time, research, and resources to learn. But it isn't harder. It just has a deeper well of knowledge to be uncovered.

Being honest, I thought I was savvy with building websites until this course. I've made some on Wordpress and Wix, and even thought I was fancy with HTML and using CSS styles from openly shared stylesheets. I just realized today that I was benefiting from the building blocks of basic coding. I look forward to when it all clicks but with all things, it is good to not label it as easier or harder. But with enough practice of the code I can see this becoming second nature.
